# CTP_Hack

Our project aims to assist CUNY students in finding essential resources by having them complete a brief questionnaire detailing the type of aid they need. Based on their responses and the specific CUNY college they attend, the system provides tailored links to relevant support services, making it easier for students to access the resources they need.
